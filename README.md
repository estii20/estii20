## Highlighted Projects

### [Perfect Pointes](https://github.com/estii20/perfect_pointes) 

I used to be a professional dancer, so I was really excited to use my dance knowledge to create an e-commerce website for pointe shoes. This was my final project for the [Code Institute Fullstack Diploma](https://codeinstitute.net/global/full-stack-software-development-diploma/?nab=2&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) 

### [Ekotera](https://github.com/estii20/eko-tera)

I'm currently working on this website for a company that installs solar carports. They have a strong environmental ethos and have some big carport projects for hotel groups in Croatia.
